## Why Slug Instead of Skia's GPU Backend?

### What Skia Actually Does on the GPU

Skia has two GPU backends: **Ganesh** (the older one, OpenGL/Vulkan/Metal) and
**Graphite** (the newer one, designed for modern explicit APIs). Both work by:

1. **Tessellating** paths into triangles on the CPU (or via compute shaders)
2. Uploading those triangles to the GPU
3. Rendering with relatively simple shaders

The key word is *tessellation*; Skia converts your curves into triangle meshes.
This means:

- Quality is **resolution-dependent**; you have to choose a tessellation
  tolerance, and if you zoom in far enough you'll see faceting
- Every time the path **transforms** (scale, rotation, perspective), you either
  re-tessellate or accept quality loss
- **Perspective projection** of curves is fundamentally broken with
  tessellation; a cubic Bezier projected through a perspective matrix is no
  longer a cubic Bezier

### What Slug Does Differently

Slug evaluates the **exact curve equations per-fragment** in the shader. This
means:

- Quality is **resolution-independent**; zoom in infinitely, edges stay perfect
- Transforms are **free**; the vertex shader handles them, the fragment shader
  doesn't care
- **Perspective is correct**; because you're evaluating the curve at each
  pixel, not approximating it with triangles
- No CPU tessellation step; the atlas is built once and never rebuilt
  regardless of transform

### Comparison

| | Skia GPU | Slug |
|---|---|---|
| Edge quality at scale | Depends on tolerance | Perfect always |
| Perspective correctness | Approximate | Exact |
| CPU work per frame | Re-tessellate on change | Nothing |
| GPU fragment cost | Cheap (just triangles) | More expensive |
| Setup complexity | High (full GPU framework) | Moderate |
| OSG integration | Very difficult | Natural |

### OSG Integration Specifically

Getting Skia's GPU backend working inside OSG would be genuinely painful:

- Skia wants to **own the OpenGL context**; it manages its own state, its own
  FBOs, its own texture atlases. OSG also wants to own the context. Getting them
  to share without stomping each other's state is a known headache.
- Skia's GPU API is **not designed to be embedded**; it's designed to be the
  renderer, not a component of one.
- You'd essentially be running two renderers side by side and compositing, which
  introduces synchronization, blending, and depth buffer problems.

Slug, on the other hand, is just **a shader and two textures**; it slots into
OSG's existing pipeline as naturally as any other `osg::Program`.

### The Real Answer to "Are You Reinventing It?"

For **2D UI / document rendering at fixed resolution**; Skia is better. It's
battle-hardened, handles edge cases you haven't thought of yet, and the
tessellation quality is fine for screen-resolution work.

For **3D scene graph rendering with arbitrary transforms and perspective**,
Slug is genuinely superior. The moment you want text or shapes on a billboard, a
HUD, a curved surface, or viewed through a perspective camera, Skia's approach
starts showing cracks and Slug's approach shines.

The fact that this library is built *inside OSG* is itself the answer; you're
in the domain where Slug's properties matter most. A shape rotating in
perspective with pixel-perfect edges at any zoom level is something Skia simply
cannot match without re-tessellating every frame.

**Slug is not reinventing what Skia solved; it's solving a different problem
that Skia deliberately doesn't address.**

# TODO

## Soon

- [ ] Add an `effectId/shapeId` UDL and helper like `slug_t/_cv/cv`
- [ ] Slug "mip-mapping"! Starting with osgSlug, introduce the ability to
  "short-circuit" the Slug quad based on some "level of detail" rule; when the
  shape is some threshold of distance AWAY, revert to simple texture lookup
  approximations. NOTE: `slughorn` MIGHT be able to participate in this
  optmization as well ... somehow
- [ ] Fix `numBands` auto-calculation and account for spatial curve
  distribution, not just count
- [x] pybind11 wrapper
- [ ] Change `composites` to `compositeShapes` in serialization, etc
- [x] Change the `autoMetrics` defaul to `true`
- [ ] Rename `slughorn-ft2.hpp` to `slughorn-freetype.hpp`
- [ ] Enforce VERSION compatibility in backends

## Medium Term

- [ ] Introduce `slughorn-harfbuzz.hpp` text API, using Harfbuzz to "shape" it
  properly. Note: it will necessarily NEED to be built on top of the FreeType2
  backend (`slughorn-ft2.hpp`)!
- [ ] Qt6 QPainterPath provides moveTo / lineTo / quadTo / cubicTo /
  closeSubpath via elementAt() iteration; maps cleanly to CurveDecomposer.
  Quadratics are native to Qt6 (unlike Cairo which works in cubics). QFont /
  QRawFont provide glyph outline extraction as a potential FreeType2 complement.
  QSvgRenderer provides SVG loading as a potential NanoSVG complement.
  Structure to match slughorn-cairo.hpp: decomposePath(QPainterPath, Atlas&).
- [ ] Allow `serial::writeJSON` for ANY object (not JUST `Atlas`)
- [ ] Helpers for the `9-slice` method of a rounded rectangle
- [x] `Atlas::createDefaultStateSet()` member instead of free function in
  `Drawable.hpp`
- [ ] Sync `TEX_WIDTH` / `kLogBandTextureWidth`; uniform or shader preamble
  injection
- [ ] Premultiplied alpha
- [ ] Proper depth testing and render order
- [x] Remove `slug_color` uniform remnant from shaders (color is pure vertex
  attribute now)

## When Ready

- [x] `Atlas::Key` type conversion (`uint32_t` -> `Codepoint | Name`
  discriminated union)
- [x] Conic subdivision for Skia circular geometry (`iter.conicWeight()`)
- [x] Minimal Skia `args.gn` build config (trim from 25GB)
- [ ] Non-square band grids (`bandMaxX != bandMaxY`)
- [ ] Layer::scale - evaluate for removal; currently only meaningful for
  FT2/text. All geometry backends leave it at 1.0. If osgSlug::Font /
  osgSlug::Text take full ownership of font-size-to-world scaling, Layer::scale
  becomes dead weight and computeQuad could take scale as a call-site parameter
  instead. Defer until text pipeline stabilizes.

## Someday / Fun

- [ ] Live `numBands` slider tool with real-time rebuild + heatmap feedback
- [ ] VSG adapter (trivial now given `slughorn` separation)
