# slughorn

`slughorn` is modern C++20 library implementing the recent OSS release of the
"Slug" GPU vector graphics rendering technique by [Eric Lengyel](https://terathon.com/blog/).
It makes no assumptions about what graphics environment being used (OpenGL,
Vulkan, WebGL, WebGPU, DirectX, etc) and instead focuses *only* on simplifying
the process of creating/ingesting vector data from various backends--or,
alternatively, by using an HTML "Canvas-like" API directly in code--so it can be
directly uploaded to the GPU as easily as possible. A backend is simply an
implementation that produces Bezier curves for `slughorn` to process to
facilitate drawing. Further code outside of `slughorn` draws the curves with a
graphics API like OpenGL, Vulkan, WebGL, WebGPU, Metal, DirectX or similar,
potentially using toolkits like but not limited to OSG / OpenSceneGraph or VSG /
VulkanSceneGraph. Companion projects ( https://github.com/AlphaPixel/osgSlug )
assist with this integration.

Furthermore, `slughorn` provides tools for traditional "offline asset"
processing (primarily in Python), as well as a [glTF](#)-compatible JSON file
format.

# Current Supported Backends

- NanoSVG
- Skia
- Cairo
- FreeType

In addition to the above backends, `slughorn` provides a "native" API for
authoring vector graphics inspired by the standard HTML `Canvas` element.

Adding support for other backends is generally as easy using a single helper
class: `slughorn::CurveDecomposer`. If your vector data can be reduced into
simple quadratic Bezier curves, `slughorn` can make it render.

## Supported Backends: FreeType

The FreeType2 backend supports standard OTF/TTF glyphs, all of the COLRv0
specification, and a large portion of the COLRv1 spec!

# Demos

| Preview | Description |
|:---:|---|
| ![Emoji Demo](https://ambaince.com/osgSlug/emojis.png) | **Emoji**<br><br>Demonstrates loading **COLRv0** and **COLRv1** emojis using the `slughorn-freetype.hpp` backend. Each layer of the emoji is composited into its own quad and positioned relative to the base.<br><br>*NOTE*: Not all features of **COLRv1** are currently supported, but will be soon. |
| [![Animated Glyphs Demo](https://ambaince.com/osgSlug/glyph-animate.webp)](https://ambaince.com/osgSlug/glyph-animate.mp4) | **Animated Glyphs**<br><br>Shader-driven animation applied to Slug-rendered glyph geometry, accomplished by adjusting the output positions in the vertex shader. |
| [![Layer Effects Demo](https://ambaince.com/osgSlug/logo.webp)](https://ambaince.com/osgSlug/logo.mp4) | **Layer Effects**<br><br>Shows how individual layers in a `CompositeShape` can not only be distinguished in the shader pipeline, but also how each layer can have its own unique fragment output. From left to right: basic fill, two GLSL algorithmic fills, traditional texture lookup, and finally an animated GLSL algorithmic fill. |
| [![Morphing Demo](https://ambaince.com/osgSlug/morph.webp)](https://ambaince.com/osgSlug/morph.mp4) | **Morphing**<br><br>Similar to the animated glyphs demo, this example shows both the shape, a simple triangle, and the debugging bounding box using the `OSGSLUG_DEBUG=3` environment variable. |
| ![2D Demo](https://ambaince.com/osgSlug/project2d.png) | **2D Projection**<br><br>The standard orthographic-style 2D placement/rendering. |
| ![3D Demo](https://ambaince.com/osgSlug/project3d.png) | **3D Projection**<br><br>The same scene as the 2D Projection above, but with a traditional perspective-style view. |
| ![Shapes/CompositeShapes](https://ambaince.com/osgSlug/shapes-compositeshapes.png) | **Shapes/CompositeShapes**<br><br>Each backend has its own examples of how to create both simple `Shape` and `CompositeShape` objects, groups of `Shape` instances layered together. The last screenshot demonstrates the `slughorn-canvas.hpp` backend, in addition to showing how the traditional punch-out effect can be achieved by manually using opposite winding directions in order to cut out one closed path from another.<br><br>*NOTE*: The `skia` backend is currently the **only** backend that supports a true stroke-to-path feature, the jigsaw puzzle piece. |
| [![3D Objects](https://ambaince.com/osgSlug/sphere3d.webp)](https://ambaince.com/osgSlug/sphere3d.mp4) | **3D Objects**<br><br>Slug is not restricted to simple quads; any 3D object or mesh can be assigned compatible `slughorn` coordinate mappings, such as spheres, cubes, curved surfaces, etc. |
| ![SVG Demo](https://ambaince.com/osgSlug/svgs.png) | **SVG**<br><br>SVG content fits easily within the `slughorn` ecosystem via the `slughorn-nanosvg.hpp` backend.<br><br>*NOTE*: Similar to the emoji support, gradients are not currently supported. |
| [![Mixed Text Demo](https://ambaince.com/osgSlug/text-mix.webp)](https://ambaince.com/osgSlug/text-mix.mp4) | **Mixed Text**<br><br>Text glyphs are simply an instance of `Shape`, and can be freely mixed with any **other** `Shape` or `CompositeShape` object. This example demonstrates replacing the character `F` with a simple triangle, which fits seamlessly into the layout process. |
| [![Text Demo](https://ambaince.com/osgSlug/text.webp)](https://ambaince.com/osgSlug/text.mp4) | **Text**<br><br>Text was the original inspiration for Slug, and will always be incredibly well-supported. As mentioned above, each glyph in a text layout is nothing more than an instance of `Shape`, and can be manipulated in any way you can imagine. :) |

cd ~/dev/skia
rm -rf out/Release

## Why Slug Instead of Skia's GPU Backend?

### What Skia Actually Does on the GPU

Skia has two GPU backends: **Ganesh** (the older one, OpenGL/Vulkan/Metal) and
**Graphite** (the newer one, designed for modern explicit APIs). Both work by:

1. **Tessellating** paths into triangles on the CPU (or via compute shaders)
2. Uploading those triangles to the GPU
3. Rendering with relatively simple shaders

The key word is *tessellation*; Skia converts your curves into triangle meshes.
This means:

- Quality is **resolution-dependent**; you have to choose a tessellation
  tolerance, and if you zoom in far enough you'll see faceting
- Every time the path **transforms** (scale, rotation, perspective), you either
  re-tessellate or accept quality loss
- **Perspective projection** of curves is fundamentally broken with
  tessellation; a cubic Bezier projected through a perspective matrix is no
  longer a cubic Bezier

### What Slug Does Differently

Slug evaluates the **exact curve equations per-fragment** in the shader. This
means:

- Quality is **resolution-independent**; zoom in infinitely, edges stay perfect
- Transforms are **free**; the vertex shader handles them, the fragment shader
  doesn't care
- **Perspective is correct**; because you're evaluating the curve at each
  pixel, not approximating it with triangles
- No CPU tessellation step; the atlas is built once and never rebuilt
  regardless of transform

### Comparison

| | Skia GPU | Slug |
|---|---|---|
| Edge quality at scale | Depends on tolerance | Perfect always |
| Perspective correctness | Approximate | Exact |
| CPU work per frame | Re-tessellate on change | Nothing |
| GPU fragment cost | Cheap (just triangles) | More expensive |
| Setup complexity | High (full GPU framework) | Moderate |
| OSG integration | Very difficult | Natural |

### OSG Integration Specifically

Getting Skia's GPU backend working inside OSG would be genuinely painful:

- Skia wants to **own the OpenGL context**; it manages its own state, its own
  FBOs, its own texture atlases. OSG also wants to own the context. Getting them
  to share without stomping each other's state is a known headache.
- Skia's GPU API is **not designed to be embedded**; it's designed to be the
  renderer, not a component of one.
- You'd essentially be running two renderers side by side and compositing, which
  introduces synchronization, blending, and depth buffer problems.

Slug, on the other hand, is just **a shader and two textures**; it slots into
OSG's existing pipeline as naturally as any other `osg::Program`.

### The Real Answer to "Are You Reinventing It?"

For **2D UI / document rendering at fixed resolution**; Skia is better. It's
battle-hardened, handles edge cases you haven't thought of yet, and the
tessellation quality is fine for screen-resolution work.

For **3D scene graph rendering with arbitrary transforms and perspective**,
Slug is genuinely superior. The moment you want text or shapes on a billboard, a
HUD, a curved surface, or viewed through a perspective camera, Skia's approach
starts showing cracks and Slug's approach shines.

Slug is solving a different problem that Skia deliberately doesn't address.
